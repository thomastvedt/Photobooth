# Photobooth
A simple raspberry pi python photobooth made for my wedding.

Based on this project: https://github.com/contractorwolf/RaspberryPiPhotobooth 
- uses RaspberryPi camera, raspistill command
- hard coded resolution on the screen I used: 1280x1024

Run on windows 10:
- http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
- http://effbot.org/downloads/PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.7.exe
- cd folder
- python main.py (need to swap out raspistill command..)
